Well, you’re the administrator! Congratulations!
Now you have special privileges to manage the system. As an administrator, you have access to many features that regular users don’t have.

What can you do as an administrator?

View user notes:
You can view all notes created by system users. This allows you to monitor their activity and control the content.

Delete users:
If a user violates the system rules (e.g., uses offensive names or behaves inappropriately), you have the right to delete their account. This may be necessary to maintain order and enforce the rules.

Delete user notes:
You also have the ability to delete user notes if they violate the rules. For example, if a note contains offensive language, threats, or any other unacceptable content.

When can you delete a user or their notes?

Rule violations: If a user uses offensive or inappropriate names, behaves aggressively, or violates other ethical standards.
Legal violations: If a user’s notes or actions pose a threat to the system’s security or break the law, you must take action.
Reports of violations: If other users report violations, you should assess the situation and make a decision based on the facts.
Disclaimer:
As an administrator, you must act responsibly. Before deleting a user or their notes, make sure you fully understand the situation and follow all necessary procedures.
