The "Notes" program allows users to create, edit, delete, search, and view their notes. Each note has a title and content. The program's administrator can view all notes created by users. Main features: creating, editing, deleting, searching, and viewing notes. 
Disclaimer! All notes you create, edit, or delete are stored in the system. If you edit or delete a note, these changes will be irreversible. Attention! The administrator can view all notes created by users. This means your information may be accessible to the system administrator. The administrator can also delete users and notes.
(FAQ): How can I restore a deleted note? Currently, the program does not support the restoration of deleted notes. Please be careful when deleting. How can I block access to my notes? At the moment, it is not possible to block access to your notes for the administrator (because, for practice, the admin has to do something). It is recommended not to store sensitive information in notes. Tips: For organizing your notes, use short titles. Use the search feature for quick access to the notes you need.

License Terms:

1. Data confidentiality: The program collects data about notes created by the user. All data is stored in the system and may be accessible to administrators of the program, but will not be shared with third parties without the user's consent, except as required by law. 

2. Disclaimer: The program is provided "as is" (kind of a parody of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 license agreement, AHAHAHAHA), with no guarantees regarding its functionality. The developers are not responsible for any malfunctions or data loss that may occur while using the program. 

3. Changes and updates: The developers of the program reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue support for the program without prior notice. 

4. You grant the right to blah, blah, blah, is anyone even going to read this?
